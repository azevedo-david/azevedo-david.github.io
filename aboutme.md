Hi there, I'm David Azevedo, Msc. Student at the [Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica), São José dos Campos, Brazil. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and I'm specializing in the field of systems and control, focused on digital twins, predictive maintenance, and health management. I am curious about applying quantitative techniques to solve advanced analytics riddles.
