In this article I will describe an exploratory data analysis and present an AutoML framework to predict the Remaining Useful
Life of Turbofan Engines given their sensors readings. Much of this work is presented by the recently published paper by
[Kefalas et. al (2021)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9486549) in the IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM).
