In this article I will describe an exploratory data analysis and present an AutoML framework to predict the Remaining Useful
Life of Turbofan Engines given their sensors readings. Much of this work is presented by the recently published paper by
[Kefalas et. al (2021)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9486549) in the IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM).

## The Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set

This dataset provides the trajectory of several sensor channels during fault evolution in a turbofan engine. Data was collected through simulating the engine degradation with the C-MAPSS software. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. This data is available at [NASA's Prognostics Center of Execellence Data Repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) and was used as challenge data for the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) data competition at PHM08.
